                <span class="yellow">What we know so far about Psyris:The Psyris are passive creatures found commonly in Crete flying in pairs. Due to their bioluminescent trails that can easily attract predators, they developed an adaptive coloration allowing them to blend in with their environment.
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature:</span> Their friendly nature makes it easy for humans to approach and they respond in fits of changing colors. They will also follow you if they are feed pollen but will fly away once they finish eating it.
